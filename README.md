# 280-M5_ROS

<br /> **Basic Description** <br />
Experimenting with a myCobot from Elephant Robotics. The 280-M5.

<br /> **Goal** <br />
To learn the fundamentals of ROS 1 by developing pick and place programs and functions for the 280 with the M5 robot controller in ROS using a linux/unix based operating system.

# How To Use (Basic Start)
I will put a basic quick start guide here and my personnel log below. I plan to make a quick start guide after I go through and learn the basics. ELog will be done before a start guide.

## What I Learned Since Starting this Project (ELog)

<br /> **Day 1: Linux** <br />
Linux was the first big challenge/hurdle to this project. I started out using an old Dell Inspirion laptop running an older version of BIOS evidently before UEFI. This presented the challenge of how to boot a Linux Distribution, in my case Ubuntu, onto the laptop. The laptop itself is running Windows 7 Home Professional. After attempting a work around with several different versions of Rufus to hopefully find one that would work with the older BIOS; I ended up formatting the Ubuntu image onto a USB and made it bootable using Rufus 3.21 on a Lenovo Thinkpad. (~ 6hr)

<br /> **Day 2: Github** <br />
This usually isn't a major process to make note of for me, but I learned a new way to use github that I think is worth documenting. In short, I learned how to set up Github on a Linux system as well as set up an SSH (Secure Shell) key for use between the Linux machine and the Github site. This allows me to push git commits to Github via command line interface from Linux. I learned this due to Github removing password authentication via command line, forcing me to learn a new method to authenticate Git. I first followed the provided link in the command line when suggesting other authentication methods. I was overloaded with information, so I took a step back and researched on Google how to authenticate Git on a Linux Distro. I found out that most easy to follow tutorials used the password method, which evidently was the very method I could not use. So, I went back to the documentation the link provided and browsed. I went ahead and started a session of ChatGPT to try and get a better understanding of what I was reading in a more layman's terms sort of way. By doing so I can get a better grasp on how the systems work. What I learned is I can generate an SSH key by using ```ssh-keygen```. However, my home/user path did not have the correct permissions for a key gen. The permissions were set to 0750 for the directory with '5' referring to read and execute, I believe, and 7 being, read, write, and execute. Since I needed to write to generate an SSHÂ key I had to update the permissions of that path using the terminal. In the terminal, to update the permissions, I used ```chmod 700 /path/to/home/dir```. Once updated, I tracked back to generate my key. I had to generate my key three times in total during the learning process. The first time I generated it I kept it simple and didn't include an email going off of what ChatGPT was suggesting. What I got in return was a private and public key. At the time, I didn't know the difference and attempted to use the private key on Github, which in turn lead me to research OpenSSH as Github denied the key due to formatting. Essentially, I go two steps forward, realize I am skipping ahead too far, and go one step backwards, or entirely to review the material again with my new knowledge on how it works of a coffee break of course :D. On my third attempt I utilized the Github documentation on how to authenticate with SSH, and behold it worked as the documentation said it would :O. I generated my key with an email attached that links to my Github account. got the public key by doing ```ssh-keygen -y -f path/to/key``` copied that from the terminal and fed it to Github. From there I should be good to go right? Wrong, I still needed to link the key to the SSH Agent. What is an SSH Agent? In short, it is a program that helps to manage SSH keys. What it does is authenticate a private key to a public key where the private key is stored on the local machine and stores that private key in memory, so a passphrase is not required each time the key is used as long as it is unlocked in the agent's memory. Basic network security stuff. Very cool and important. Anyways, now that Github is set up and the repository is cloned with SSH I am good to go! (~ 8hr)

<br /> **Day 3: Setting up ROS** <br />

<br /> **3.1 Accidental Learning** <br />
Installed FUSE and learned how to run appImages. This is necessary for myStudio to run so I can set up the necessary firmware and drivers for the robot. This path put me off track. I ran into some issues trying to run the appimage for the software and was uncomfortable installing it via just the tar.gz source code. I decided to check the ROS 1 Gitbook and start off from there and back track as needed for setting it up. Note to self and others: ROS 1 Gitbook will provide documentation on how to set up a VM with Virtual Box so anyone can set up a Linux VM to run the 280-M5 cobot with ROS in a Linux VM. (~ 2hr)

<br /> **3.2 ROS 1 Environment Setup** <br />
Installing ROS 1 for Ubuntu versions 20+ via: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu <br />
Chose Desktop-Full Install for ROS 1 Noetic. <br />
Problem. I am running Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) and trying to install ROS 1 Noetic for Ubuntu Focal (20.04). Work arounds -> Install Ubuntu Focal or Install manually. Will attempt manual install. Did additional research. Decided to adjust scope to ROS2 Humble which works with Ubuntu Jammy (22.04). Note ROS 2 Foxy Maintnance Period on May 2023. (~ 2hr)

<br /> **3.3 ROS 2 Environment Setup** <br />
Installing ROS 2 for Ubuntu Jammy via: 
<br /> https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/12-ApplicationBaseROS/12.2-ROS2/12.2.1-ROS2%E7%9A%84%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85.html
<br /> http://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html <br />

Problem. While attempting install ran into a roadblock with adding the ROS 2 repo to APT. Problem Repo is malformed entry. Removed APT line with the following.
```
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt autoremove
# Consider upgrading for packages previously shadowed.
sudo apt upgrade
```
Resotred system to working order. Looking at other ways to add the apt line either via fish-shell or the GUI. Well fun fact. Bash ins preinstalled! and to use it with fish-shell simply do ```bash -c 'command'```. I spent the last 3 hours trying to find out I can just do a simple bash -c command. Oh well.

<br />

ROS2 Humble is installed! setup to work with bash. To enter bash via fish-shell simply type ```bash``` to enter.

<br /> 
To finish up I installed moveit2. 
<br />

Next, I set up a ROS2 workspace. (~ 4hr)
```
# Create a folder
mkdir -p Documents/Github/280-M5_ROS/colcon_ws/src
# compile workspace
cd ~/colcon_ws
colcon build
```

<br />
OTutorial 1 Topics: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html
<br /> <br />
Topics: are one of the main ways in which data is moved between nodes and therefore between different parts of the system. ```rqt_graph``` is a command line that gives the user the ability to inspect ROS2 topics. I like to think of an MQTT Server. It has a topic, publisher, and subscriber. The publisher sends a message to a topic and all subscribers of that topic will get that message. A topic is what connects the node that connects the message from the publisher to all subscribers.
